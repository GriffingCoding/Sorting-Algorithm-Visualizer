when editing or creating new reminder or group or anything it provides a screen to the right
side that has a smooth animation moving from right to left and opposite when exit

middle screen will display reminders and groups actually it will dynamically change the title
and display everything if nothing then state so

account button also goes to middle screen... with editing available

basically left is navigation middle is display and right is create/edit tasks/reminders

create counters in left side categories

allow for sub tasks????? nope thats for the groups


search bar lists name matched task and when clicked, display in middle



first step is allow to create tasks and put into the correct categories and list them off
